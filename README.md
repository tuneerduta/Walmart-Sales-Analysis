**----Improvements----**

1) As the delivery time taken is much more for the products to be delivered. So we should consult with the delivery agents and ask about this mishap.

2) There are some customers who are hardly buying products. So we need to go to them or give some offeres to only those customers.

3) We should look to the quality or return rate of the products in Nevada State because it the least ordering State.

4) We should study the customer feedback and the reviews in our online platform.

5) Prices of the least selling products should be given some discount.
